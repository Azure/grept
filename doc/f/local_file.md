# `local_file` Fix Block

The `local_file` fix block in the `grept` tool is used to write a specified content into one or more local files. This can be used to enforce certain file content rules.

## Attributes

- `rule_id`: The ID of the rule this fix is associated with.
- `paths`: A list of file paths where the content should be written.
- `content`: The content to be written to the files.

## Exported Attributes

The `local_file` fix block does not export any attributes.

## Example

Here's an example of how to use the `local_file` fix block in your configuration file:

```hcl
fix "local_file" "example" {
  rule_id = "example_rule"
  paths   = ["/path/to/file1", "/path/to/file2"]
  content = "Example content"
}
```

This will write the text "Example content" to the files at `/path/to/file1` and `/path/to/file2` if the rule with ID `example_rule` fails.
