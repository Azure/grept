# `git_ignore` Fix Block

The `git_ignore` fix block in the `grept` tool is used to manage the `.gitignore` file in a repository. This block can be used to ensure certain entries are present or absent in the `.gitignore` file. If there's no `.gitignore` file, this fix would create one.

## Attributes

- `rule_ids`: The ID list of the rules this fix is associated with. Any rule check failure would trigger this fix.
- `exist`: A list of entries that must be present in the `.gitignore` file.
- `not_exist`: A list of entries that must not be present in the `.gitignore` file.

## Exported Attributes

The `git_ignore` fix block does not export any attributes.

## Example

Here's an example of how to use the `git_ignore` fix block in your configuration file:

```hcl
fix "git_ignore" "example" {
  rule_ids   = ["example_rule"]
  exist      = ["*.log", "tmp/"]
  not_exist  = ["*.bak"]
}
```

This will ensure that the entries `*.log` and `tmp/` are present in the `.gitignore` file, and the entry `*.bak` is not present. If the rule with ID `example_rule` fails, the `.gitignore` file will be updated accordingly.

You can also use the `exist` attribute alone to ensure certain entries are present:

```hcl
fix "git_ignore" "example" {
  rule_ids = ["example_rule"]
  exist    = ["*.log", "tmp/"]
}
```

Or use the `not_exist` attribute alone to ensure certain entries are not present:

```hcl
fix "git_ignore" "example" {
  rule_ids   = ["example_rule"]
  not_exist  = ["*.bak"]
}
```

These will update the `.gitignore` file accordingly if the rule with ID `example_rule` fails.
